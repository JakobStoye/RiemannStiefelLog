Matlabcode for the Riemannian logarithm
on the Stiefel manifold under the canonical metric

The algorihm solves the "geodesic endpoint problem" locally.



This script conducts the canonical Stiefel logarithm 
for artifical pseudo-random Stiefel data.
It performs 10 runs and outputs the average iteration count.
